- #####: a ball of heavily compacted flour, with a harder outer shell for preservation and transport.  It is dissolved into butter tea forming something akin to porridge, with a slightly nutty taste.  Often seasoned with 

Tears of Twar: a gum that, when heated, has the unique property of bursting into shards that further melt into a viscous liquid with a liquorice flavour.

  

  

# Flora 

## Candramukhī
(Lit: moonflower) so called as it blooms during the night; a species of ipomoea native to the Pahadas.  When consumed produces.  Intense auditory hallucinations, an effect utilised in Pami rites, rituals, a and medicine, as well recreationally.

  
candramukī Śāhī (lit.: kingly) is a species of moon flower that blooms only during periods of intense moonlight (a full moon on a clear night).

  

## Chuka
Produces a tall

The stem is tough but edible and quite tart.  When cooked it softened and takes on a sweeter, more palatable aromatic flavour, often used in desserts.  The stem is filled with clear water of mild sweetness that is generally collected and drunk during or soon after harvest as a novelty.

## Aerochs

[/ˈaʊrɒks/](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) pl.: Aerochs or Aerochsen

एरोक _Romanised:_ Ērōka (lit. sky Wanderer)

  

Inspired by _Megralyth_ (Aether Airwhale)

  

### Lesser Aeroxs

### Greater Aerochs

The Greater Aeroch

  

due to their aeronautical nature, aerochs are rarely seen outside of ox-falls (whale-falls)

## Ghost moths

Bhūta kīrā (lit. Ghost moth) are a species of nocturnal moth characterised by their translucent wings.  They reside in rocky terrain, i.e scree slopes, mirroring the locals of the moonflower, which provides nectar for adult moths and are in turn pollinated.

  

## Greugar
A large sapient species of primate, the Greugar are native to Pahad

## Zooxanthellae Symbionts
The Zooxathellea (zooxs) has one unique feature in that it produces a positively buoyant lifting gas as a byproduct of its unique photosynthetic process.  This feature is foundational to the unique ecology of Pahad’s skies.  The substance is a miracle of nature that has yet to be explained by alchemy, wizardry, the divine, or even the novel perversities of the so-called “nature” philosophy.

The Zooxs' unique photosynthetic process produces an extraordinary amount of heat, more so than would be gained via a direct thermo-voltaic process.  Whether this violates the conservation of energy is under ongoing investigation.  The prevailing belief is that the lifting gas has negative mass.
### Medusoza
A class of medusoza whose medusa stage features a greatly expanded mesoglea (an interior sac between the epidermis and gastrodermis) that forms the animal’s aerostatic skeleton.  Lifting gas produced by zooxs on the epidermis is collected in the mesoglea, and diffuses through the gastrodermis by binding to the membrane.   Trailing tentacles extend through the opening, allowing for filter feeding.  Most species are categorised as plankton, as they possess no locomotive abilities, and are thus beholden to the winds.

  

One interesting adaptation of predatory jellies is the enclosing of the muscular ring, allowing for a system that, in conjunction with the mouth, functions similarly to an airlock.  This ensures that only a non-critical amount of gas escapes the gastrovascular cavity during ingestion of larger prey items such as birds and other small aerial animals.

These predatory jellies attack by descending rapidly when contract is made with a tentacle.  Once the item had been ensnared, the jelly will deposit any solid waste, so as they retain some buoyancy.

  

Some aeroplankton demonstrate a process similar the diel vertical migration, whereby throughout a 24 hour cycle, they migrate from the uppermost to lowermost aerial horizons.  This process is independent from changes due to diel air currents, however to two may be related.  

By regulating the amount of lifting gas that displaces air, a plankter may influence their buoyancy.  In jellies this is done by regulating the amount of lifting gas in the gastrovascular cavity.  As lifting gas is produced at a constant rate, descent is easier than ascend.

  

Polyps may attach themselves to different environs, e.g solid ground, algae mats, or even aerochs.
