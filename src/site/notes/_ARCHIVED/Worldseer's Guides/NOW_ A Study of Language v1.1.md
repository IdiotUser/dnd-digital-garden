Finnish, Swedish, Latin, old Icelandic, gothic language

# Aquan

**Writing:**	Quipu, the language of knots.[^1]
**Sounding:**	Although mostly composed of gesture and motion, the verbal component of the Aquan language is composed of clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls.[^2]  These verbalisations are utilised for navigation and physical descriptions.[^3]  
**Learnable?:**	~~It is not uncommon for sailors of the \[sea\] to learn phrases in~~ The suggestion is impossible due to the language architecture of Aquan evolving from aquatic, water breathing species, as such it is impossible for air breathers to speak.

# Celestial

Hebrew, the language of the gods.

**Quirk:**	Literal.

“Celestial is a version of the language that defines reality so speaking something that is unreal is impossible. To speak a lie about something as simple as "That grass is purple" you have to hedge it into awkward hypothetical statements like "That grass (could be) purple", which would of course make it incredibly obvious to another Celestial speaker that you're trying to lie.  
It also means you are at a severe disadvantage to hide your feelings or intentions when speaking to another person in Celestial. There are honorifics and forms of address that cannot be spoken without conveying what that means to the speaker and if you wish to hide negative attitudes, you have to speak very carefully to avoid pronouncing them \- which generally comes across as being rude and uncouth anyway so it's a lose-lose situation most of the time. Honesty is always the best policy when speaking Celestial.”[^4]

# Common \- Welsh

Owing to its origins in human evolution as animalistic grunts, true common is a magically inert language, and can’t be heard by gods.  However, due to the borrowing of words, modern common is detectable, but any meaningful spell cast in common relies on the magic of further entities.

# Elvish \- Finnish/Elvish

“Elves could carry on a conversation within a conversation that non native speakers could not understand.”[^5]

# Draconic \- Greek?

Draconic is technical language of magic: more akin to mathematics and physics and thus is related to infernal. It's intimidating sounds is actually just dreadful confusion.[^6]

# Deep Speech

# Druidic \- Old Irish Gaelic

# Dwarvish \- Old Norse

Absolute direction.  North, South, East, West, Surface, Core.  
Difficulty with relative direction.  Mixes lefts and rights.

[Dwarfish phrases \- Discworld & Terry Pratchett Wiki](https://wiki.lspace.org/Dwarfish\_phrases)

# Giant \- Swedish

# Gnomish \- German

# Infernal \- Vulcan

“Infernal always masks truth and intent. Insight checks always fail against conversation in Infernal.”[^7]

“One thing I've played with in Infernal is that it's a language designed to conceal and ensnare. Sentences form a sort of linguistic spider's web where every clause changes its meaning depending on strange, obtuse interactions with neighbouring clauses, and their neighbouring clauses. Infernal contracts are even worse because they can be read in multiple directions, each one yielding a different message. Vital pieces of a contract can be hidden in an ocean of meaningless jargon so that even people experienced with the language can find themselves unintentionally signing away their soul based on a single vertically-constructed word in the middle of the 76th page. Devilish poetry involves finding ways to cram as many profane ideas into as few words as possible."

# Sylvian

# Under Common - dark speech (Tolkien)

# Primordial

The language of the old gods. [^8]


Primordial is truth.  To speak the language of the old gods is to speak the tongue of magic.  Single words hold powerful magic, capable of pulling the weave[^9].  But be warned, to speak it is to broadcast your intent and commit without consultation.  Some do not take kindly to such blasphemy.[^10]

Primordial dictionaries are the spellbooks of the most powerful wizards.  Some devote their entire lives to the pursuit of truth in Earth.  Others may seek to join a brotherhood[^11] of Mages to quicken the pace, but first one must gain their trust as their tomes are closely guarded secrets.  Underground wars of espionage and infiltration are held between brotherhoods.

What is to happen if a word were to be spilled?  Chaos.  Fortunately, this is impossible.  Some gods believe themselves mediators of magic, and anyone who were to attempt such an act would meet a swift end.  This, however, is unnecessary.  For so many to pull a string, would result in the absence of the string from the Weave.  It would be as if the string had not existed in the first place, for the Weave is not beholden to the laws of space and time.  The Weave is space and time.

**A non cannon idea**  
The Weave is the language of Totality (the universe/cosmos).  It was developed by Law as a common language to manipulate the non-existence into Totality.  It remains as a remnant of creation (CMBR), and can be observed in all all.  A backdoor to Totality, if one can 

# Orc \- Orkish (Tolkien)

# Wizard \- Latin

Thermionic Valves  
~~Temp~~

Thaumionic  
Relating to the emission of reality from thaumaturgic methods.

Arcane ion ic

**The Weave/Entropy** Akin to energy.  
**Humes** a unit of measurement for the level of reality (1Hu \= magically inert)  
**Arcane Flux** a unit of measurement for the flow of magic (high reality positions flow to low reality positions, measured as flux)  
**Octarine** The colour of magic.  
*“Magic smells like the colo\[u\]r purple, tastes like the touch of silk, and feels like petrichor.*  
*Magic defies reality as we understand it, so I personally imagine it defying our experiential understanding of the universe.”[^12]* scēperrum[^13]

[^1]:  Sailors, knots.  Do you see the connection?  It has been noted that some vessels containing aquatic natives have been known to learn knotting, embedding insults and guidelines into the rigging.

[^2]:  Whale sounds.

[^3]:  These physical descriptions are purely logical, lacking the nuance of motion and gesture.  To describe a face in verbal Aqual, one may describe the contours as ridges, sea cliffs, and reef like.

[^8]:  Gods so old that they are without direct worshipers.  Additionally, To refer to them as “old gods” is not entirely accurate.  They are ideas rather than entities.  There may be gods of law, nature, and stone, but this does not exclude Law, Nature, and Stone from existing.

[^9]:  In old times, the Weave was believed to be a direct form of magic.  However, magic is but one thread of what is now known as the fabric of reality.

[^10]:  Some define Blasphemy as such: Blasphemy.  Magic without gods.

[^11]:  Brotherhoods are not necessarily male exclusive.  It is a quirk of the common tongue to refer to ungendered things as male.
