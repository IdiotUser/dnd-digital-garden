This week I want you to create an interesting character. Be creative. Be inventive. Describe the characters physical and personality characteristics. Focus on two of their defining characteristics.

Write your response here:

**Introduction:** 
A tall, slender figure approaches, wearing large brown overalls and a hat that covers their face in shadow.  They seem to sway in the wind, but that can’t be as there is none.  They stop half a metre away and reach out a red gloved hand, “Good day to you.” The sound seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at the same time, “My name is Lewis” and with that you realise their hand is actually a claw.

**Origins:** 
She was experimented on by a druid named Mwarf who went mad and developed a phobia of crabs (for some unknown reason). He thus sold her and she was purchase by a large, kind potato farmer called Cilthos Franklin, who adopted her as a daughter.  

She was very happy living with Cilthos, (keeper of potato) but when he got older he wanted her to inherit the potato farm.  Appalled at the idea of being a potato farmer (which would be all but impossible due to her size) she ran away.

  

**Appearance:**  
**Single:** By herself, Lewis looks like a small moon crab from the peanut mangroves.  With a pair of purple claws, eight orange-red legs, an almost entirely black upper carapace, two yellowish spots behind the eyes and three (unlike the usual two) small, whitish spots on the lower-centre carapace.

**Swarm**: During dark night Lewis can (or rather cannot) be seen stacked on-top of a swarm of crabs both big and small.  Covered in a large trench-coat brushing the ground and wearing a large center-creased, soft brimmed hat.  On occasion they have been misinterpreted as illegal magic items dealers but the look they are trying to achieve is one of an investigator.

  

**Personality:** 

Lewis is a highly intelligent (by crab standards) yet idiotic crab, she is egotistical to an extreme (partly because she is the smartest crab ever) and has many ambitions such as: 

1. Be leader of a colony of crabs,
2. Become the worlds greatest investigator, and
3. Forgive dad.
