# Personality:
Has a great interest in the anatomy of creatures, especially humanoids. Naturally, this makes them a knowledgeable doctor. Desires to one day create a body of their own. To achieve this they believe they must first discover how they have sentience. This leads to the study of necromancy, and by extent, magic.

**Flaw:**
Believes suffering is a fate worse than death, and is convinced that to murder a victim is a mercy. The dead do not have possessions, thus their body may be taken without remorse. A grave has very little use aside from preventing easy access to bodies. Although they do recognise the emotional aid they provide to the grieving - small minded fools.

_The figure leans over the body and pulls a dagger on it. Its screams fill the air as it flails on the ground, a second cut sliences it. “They did not have to suffer like that, next time, I’ll need not cut twice.”_

**Ideals:**

Hates authority, they cause unnecessary suffering. **Chaotic**

_“No one deserves to suffer, it is a fate worse than death. So I make things right.”_ **Evil**

Values all life equally, as such, kills as easily as one would put down a dog.

~~Bluntness and disregard of life stem from the belief that your soul will~~

**Quirks:**

“What’s the worst that could happen?”
“At least we’re not dead.”
“Well we all know I’m not a skeleton.”
“Halfwits!”
Perpetual agony due to persistent hunger and thirst as they haven’t discovered their ability to eat or drink.
Remains extra Lý still.
Female: “long haired human”
Male: “short haired human”
There ain’t no grave, can hold my body down.

# **BACKSTORY _“Revised”_**

An old, reclusive wizard (father) employed the services of skeletons to tend to chores. The wizard fell ill and found lesser skeletons to be poor at tending to the living: plants, pets, people. As such, he AwAkened one in hopes that it would be able to learn and teach itself, eventually being able to take the role of a nurse or such like (this is where doctor background comes in). Unfortunately, the wizard died before the effect could properly come to fruition (awakened spell 30 day period). The lesser skeletons grew Ferrell (no control) while the awakened continued to attempt to follow its master’s wishes. A small library had been amassed and the skeleton learn how to perform more advanced magikal methods (including gentle repose - a useful tool for healing the sick).

This routine continued for some time, the skeleton took up gardening (note: humans **DO NOT** eat dirt, removing dirt from the mouth and replacing it with new dirt **DOES NOT** count as sustenance, humans are not pot plants - changing bed = repotting, drinking = watering, sitting in the sun = ???, entertainment = phonograph). One day, maybe years after the death of the master, and while the awakened was neither here nor there, thieves burgled into the rumoured horde of a dead wizard’s overgrown tower. Taking time to dislodge old letters, and bury the dead.

The Awakened returned to ransacked rooms, finding a note addressed to one _“Taurine Tallow”_ saying: _“I thank you for your hospitality these past few months. You have allowed me to get back on my feet and for that I am forever grateful. I have been offered a place on a research vessel chartered to the proposed southern expanse this coming summer, which I intend to follow through with. If ever you need any assistance, or even just to see an old friend, call on me at \[ADDRESS IN WIZARD TOWN]. I promise to have a kettle brewing for you when you arrive._” ~ \[NPC of interest], the \[LONG ROAD WITH MELANCHOLY NAME], 1241AB.

Well it has been some time since then, and Tallow has set off to see their once-dead master. Who knows how this ill-prepared cadaverous caster will fare on the journey?

# ~~Learned?:~~

Humans are many. First there were few, they ran. So I did too. I waited awhile and saw that they did not run from other Humans. It is best to look like a human around humans, I have my Magiks for that.

I have entered a Human nest. There are many kinds of Humans, but all can either be _Short-haired_ or _Long-haired_ types. I do not think I am either, so I think I must not be Human.

There are places you go if you have nowhere else to go. They serve strange plants on plates.

- Note: You must exchange things for plates, I tried to give them magik, but then _Blackcloaks_ came.

The _Blackcloaks_ are best avoided. They do not like the Magikal Method, I do not like the _Blackcloaks_.

- They bring strange man-beasts on leashes to sniff out _Magikians_.
- Some _Magikians_ fight back, they kill _Blackcloaks_ with Magiks, but more _Blackcloaks_ come.

I went into a homeless home and watched a homeless trade shinies for plates. I do not think I want plates, but shinies get you more than plates.

I tried talking to a _shorthaired_, they gave me their shinies, this was nice. They ran away, so I did too.

I met another _Magikian_. It was a short-haired _Longhair_ who was also able to sniff out _Magikians_.

- _Short-haireds_ do not always have short hair, some have long hair but still look like _Short-haireds_.
- We rested together and learned from each other.
- ~~They were once that of a five, but escaped because there was a~~ _~~shorthaired~~_ ~~counterpart.~~
- They told me _Blackcloaks_ are not to be trusted, that no one is to be trusted because they could be working for the _Blackcloaks_.
- The _man-beasts_ are called Timnus Rowan, or Ariel, or Georgia. But all are Captives.
- My _Magikian_ is called Verdanna and Merriweather.
- I told them I was Taurine and Tallow. They said I was a liar, then they left.
- I found my _Magikian_ with the _Blackcloaks_ when the moon left, they are a Captive now.

The Captives fight the _Blackcloaks_ sometimes. When I went into a new nest, one had broken some _Blackcloaks_ with the help of another _Magikian_. Now I am following them.

**The First Day of “Remembrance Book”, \[YEAR - FEW]**

I am now with the “_resistance_”. We are only five, but it is better to travel in smaller packs.
  
The Four:
- The halfling
- The Longhaired _Shorthaired_ Elf
- The half-Elf
- The Orc

I have learn many things with _The Four_. For one, _The Four_ were once five. The fifth was a _Longhaired_ Elf, a close companion of the _Shorthaired_ one. ~~Apparently the~~ _~~Longhaired~~_ ~~was also Verdana and Merriweather~~. I told them that I could be their fifth, this made them sad, happy, and other things.

They have told me that they do not tell each other

Apparently there is no and before a second name, instead it is of, or nothing at all.

Elves are tall and have pointy ears.

Halflings are half the size of a man.

Half-Elves are like men, but also like Elves.

Orcs are not like men, but also like men.

_Longhaireds_ are called Females

_Shorthaireds_ are called Males.

# **~~- “Childhood”:~~**

Little to no memory of life.
Calls their resurrector “father”.
Father sets out on a campaign to southern lands. (due back 3yrs. Probably later)
Skeleton travels to father’s mentor.
No one home. (Left of Rancid)
Lived there for 9 months. (cleans up)
Teaches other skeletons music. (Skeleton band)
Odd jobs for money to go to Rancid.
Eventually forks out enough.
Born from experiment.
Held in lab.

Meets flumph?
Circumstances lead to the skeleton achieving sentience.
The Researchers falsely believe that they have finally created a soul, inside said skeleton. They celebrate, and then begin the search for the soul.
They are unable to find it due to what they believe is the potent necrotic magic that holds it together, its life force, interfering with the delicate instruments and thus masking the soul. In actuality it is the fact that the skeleton has no soul at all. And their assumption that a soul is required for sentience is false.
The researchers try and try to fix the machine by creating a filter that is able to hide the necrotic magics from the machine, giving them a chance to see the soul. During this time, the skeleton spends more and more time with the researchers, failed skeletons, test subjects, and the flumph.
Eventually they are able to develop the necrofilter, and, to their dismay, it is revealed that the skeleton has no soul.

~~A - One gets attached to it.~~
	B - A flumph that is being experimented on spends time with the skeleton, becomes attached to it.
	Are unable to find the soul.
Researchers decide that the best course of action is to snuff the life that is masking the soul.
	A - Someone has reservations about this.
		I. Takes action, skeleton (theft), and research (fire).
		II. Tells flumph. Flumph takes action.

Takes skeleton

The result of an experiment with the aim of creating artificial life without a soul. Was successful.
	Why not use warforged? They have souls

Childhood consists of <30 day period before true awakening.
	Made friend(s)?
	Met a flumph? Or recruited mindwitness?
	Trauma?
		Trauma leading to charm breaking, thus true awakening?

_“After the greater reveal._
_The researchers had gone to a tavern to celebrate the victory of their comrade, and by extension the completion of their goal. One of the researchers noted to this comrade that it was a shame that the newly sentinet would have to be culled for them to determine how it had became as such._

A group of researchers attempting to… ~~bring back the dead? Create the best warriors~~/ create an unresting workforce.
	Started with potions of haste. Lead to exhaustion.
	Came to the conclusion that skeletons were the answer. But skeletons can’t report back, make business decisions, or lead an army.
	Devolved into a cult of necromancers.

**Fleshed**
There was once a time that I had flesh. That time is long past, and those who knew me are long forgotten. I remember little of being alive, enjoying the comforts of life. Since my reanimation by the man whom I can only call my father, my cruel imitation of life has been blissful. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Father set off on an expedition to the fabled southern lands, scheduled to come back after 3 winters. He entrusted me in the care of his old master, as such, I went on an expedition of my own.

Upon my arrival to my "grandfather's" house in the woods, I was greeted with a ransacked home. In which I found three things: A dirty, old lyre lying against the bed-frame. Obviously the looters had not seen much value in it; A small, secret bookshelf that required my magic to find, and to retrieve. A couple scrolls of magic to learn, of course, a spare spellbook (little more than bound sheets) and a children's tale by the name of "The Wind in the Willows"; finally, amongst the broken china, a message that I believed to be from the owner: "Gone to Raccid, house is free." And so, I decided that I would go there too.

After "living" in the house for three sessions, I got in contact with a smuggler who claimed they could get me to Raccid, for a fee of course. Naturally, this was too much for me at the time. He told me he would come back in the springtime, and that I should find the money.

I neglected to mention it to you earlier, but during my travels I had amassed a small following of skeletons. They didn't make for much company, but I felt comforted that I wasn't the only one around. I don't know what brought it about, but I felt the need to pass something on to them. But what could I? I tried to teach them magic, but to no avail. How to enjoy things, but they would not have it. I started to feel like they were not quite the same as me. I had something of a brain, however small, and they did not. How cruel the world is, to give me complex thought, and not them. Although, maybe they had been smiled upon, and not I. They had eternal bliss, I had to feel. Eventually they were delegated to cleaning the house. Something to keep them busy while I was out.

It was during the winter, I came back to find Samira cleaning my songhorn. Then it struck me! (Although, that may have just been Pat.) I could teach them to play! I started with the songhorn. Unfortunately, as we later discovered, no one other than I could draw breath. Another cruelty of the world. I then tried the lyre. Thankfully this was an instrument that would not require air, and even more graciously, an instrument Samair appeared to have an affinity for. I was overjoyed, at once I set out to the village in search of old instruments. By now they knew me as “That One in the Woods” and I

I started playing in local taverns and doing odd jobs for the villagers. They said I was unnaturally fit for such a small build, claiming I could work my fingers to the bone. How little they knew.

# Poetry

There was once a time that I felt like gelatin.
Which is to say, I had flesh.
Back then, life just meshed.
But that was a time you’d best be forgettin’

For this is the story of why I have no melanin.
Or for that matter, skin.
And also why I'm so thin.
And why every time she sees me, I scare poor Ms Merilyn.

Now, about this part I am less certain.
Only that I was trying to hide.
Which was followed by that time when I died.
I then awoke as a skeleton.

In a town called Beledon.
At the time my brain was so small.
And everyone else seemed so tall.
Back in the small town that housed The Pelican.

Of learning I became so eager and,
During this time I had,
What could only be described as a dad.
Although, he was really just a necromen.

One day I came across a place in which I had a connection.
But they did not like the sound of my rattling bone.
As such, they barred me from my old home.
A home I was never again to set foot in.

Also, just in case I need to bring it up again, I am not American.
By know I’m sure you know,
What this story is about, unless you are quite slow,
This is the story of why I am a skeleton.

There was once a time that I had flesh,
Back then, life just meshed.
Then I was mugged,
By a gang of thugs.
They cut out my eye,
And left me to die.

The scoop she pulled from within the crucible, ladened with molten metal in which was lowered over the eyes of the man and then poured - They collapsed, smoked, and were destroyed entirely - And the screams and smell of burning flesh emanated from that small shed.
