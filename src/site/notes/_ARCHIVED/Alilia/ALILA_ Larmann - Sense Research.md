# Sight

I have recently been informed that certain creatures are able to see beyond what I previously thought possible. For example: colour. I myself are unable to see colours. To me they are a foreign concept providing no Benicia to the sad imitation of life I lead. I believe there is a way to provide such sight as colour through the manipulation of the optic lenses ~~nerve. Unfortunately, this does not help me.~~

I have had a breakthrough. ~~My struggles with the optic nerve proved unfruitful, as such I became frustrated and began looking into the formation of the eye instead.~~ During this investigation, I discovered a difference between the lenses of a creature with “dark vision” and one without.
