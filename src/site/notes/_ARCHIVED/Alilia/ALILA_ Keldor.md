I was imprisoned by my brother (Idris the deceiver), and freed by a mighty warrior whom I have named my champion. A warrior on pigback bearing the mark of Keldor (reverse mark of Idris) on their shield.

To pledge your allegiance to me I ask you to undertake a ritual (soul contract, mark of Keldor tattoo with [SPELL]).
