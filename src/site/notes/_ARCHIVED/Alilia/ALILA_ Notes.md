The Journey to the West

1249AB/Winster Era/Groggle Fogâ€™s Day

Today we arrived at Midbury, the first stop in our journey. Upon arrival we were scanned for magic by followers of Idris with a pet - a decrepit old man on a chain. Our driver informed us that he would be back in a couple of days to continue the journey, in the meantime, I visited the tavern with several of my wagon goers. One of them invited the rest of us to follow them
