Rumours

SWORD

The sword used by the Holy Peer, Roncevaux, at the battle of Cordoba. It is said that he felled 50 men after his battalion had fled, and sword broken, before being struck down. Alstroemeria saw his bravery and revivified his body, blessing the sword with the light of the moon.

Many say that it dazed those who gazed at its brilliance, and could be identified under the light of the moon as it would shine more brilliantly and any embellishments would dissolve.

**Possession by the blade:** Depending on the size of the fragment, ranging from mild suggestions to full possession. Most powerful during a clear night, with the moon in full view.

Many say the voice of Roncevaux can be heard through the sword, clearest with the largest pieces. Some fragments have different aspects of his personality, some mightn’t want to return, preferring to compel others to kill without reason. Final completion may lead to a wholeness of the mind, many realisations/clarity - leading to regrets, a less manic almost reminded tone, and request for assistance with redemption.

Completion causing/needing a blue moon. Not all fragments needed, but improving mental state and power. A tipping point where raging, manic turns to expert chivalric.

A blood moon being bad.

Crazy powered? Evil completion? High possession probability with even small fragments?

**Redemption**

Asking to be allowed to take over the body? Raging?

Claims that the original fragments have powerful magical properties. Rumours of knives that cut stone, untarnishable razors, findings of individuals gazing at the moon with a knife in hand and the heart of the person of a recent feud, and broken voices that followed those who held them.

Murder skull, soul of Roncevaux shattered and kept in the pieces of the sword.

Hex blade / echo knight.

Moonblade?

# Ring of Ribbons

Etymology: RQG;BS2 - rainfall scarf

Magician’s sleeve scarfs?

The ring allows the wearer to pull a seemingly unlimited amount of kerchieves from any crevice, providing the ring first disappears into said crevice. Kerchieves drawn may be used to conceal an object, cast the prestidigitation spell, and reveal a change.
