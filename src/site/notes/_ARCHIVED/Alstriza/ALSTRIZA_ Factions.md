Around since the original primaries, promoted soon after their “disappearance”

Ezekiel met Mwarf during his exhibitions across the continents, soon coming into regular contact. During the Hunts, Ezekiel saw to it that Mwarf and as many other druids were protected within Altriza Proper, and eventually all territories under the government of ALSTRIZA.

The Sainfoin is a Primary in charge of appeasing and tending to the gardens of Alstriza.

Morfoot also headed the Society for Botanical Sciences (SBS) for 3 terms.

### Sainfoin (Lesser Gardeners)

Saineolaí (Plural)

The saineolai are descended from the last of the old Druid circles. Hidden within the walls of Altriza during the Druidic trials/hunts/burnings.

Saved from extinction, new sages are now trained within the Sanctuary and the gardens they tend to. Outsiders are forbidden Ed to end the gardens, however the law of sanctuary still applies, yet is seldom employed. Sages number such that most villages are within the reach of a sage for healing.

# Blackfort Company

The Blackfort Company consists of the shadows of the great knights of The Black Fort. They are usually found travelling alone on the old roadways that were once of their domain. If you are to ever cross them on their phantom steeds, it is best to clear a path and avert your gaze. Less you see something… unsightly.

Seldom are they seen together, when they are, let it be known that a great evil is afoot and should be ignored by even the most inquisitive of minds. Currently it is known that the fort is being held by a dark power, able to command the company. Little is known more.
