[[A Chance Encounter Amy&Vile]]

Vile & Amy, sitting at a heavy wooden table, that was probably a very expensive, but now sun-bleached, water damaged, and covered in scores of tiny round scorch marks.

...

Vile: "Wasn't pretty"

Amy: "I didn't expect it to be.  But I want to hear it.  If you're willing it tell it."

Vile: Ha.

*It was defiantly a laugh and not a cough this time, Amy was getting better at telling them apart.*

Vile: okay...

...
Vile: *look up into empty space* do you want to tell it?... Fine... I'm not stopping you.

Vile: *extinguishing the cigarette butt on the table, adding another mark, taking a deep breath, posture straightening significantly,*

\[Mr Cyndwern takes over story]

In the brief period of time Amy had gotten to know Vile, she had noticed he had been short with his words.  Understandable, given the discomfort it so obviously brought him.  Now however, it seems as if he were being deliberately poetic.

Cyndwern

You wonder why I still use my given name?  Because it's mine.  Of all the things he gave me, its one of the only ones I have positive memories of.  We – my siblings, Emnity and Nithe – still use our names at home, but they've taken more... palatable parish names.  We still use them at home though.  Pengdylan had a right shock when Emnity brought him round the first time.  Too polite to comment though; Emnity chose well.

I hated it when mother called me Wern.  It was his name, not mine.  If Emnity ever called me Vile, she would "correct" her. Likewise with "Cyndi".  Nithe got away with it, 'cause==...==  I think she wanted to pretend we were a normal family.  We weren't, obviously.  Father didn't care, he'd always called us Cyndwern.  Bloody confusing when he'd ask "Cyndwern" to pass the salt, and we'd all reach for it from the other end of the table.  I think Nithe did it deliberately, just to piss him off.

...
It was different when it was just us.  Now Emnity has the kids, I try to limit their exposure to my... habits.  She always says: "I wished you could stay", and I always refuse.  I'm sure, secretly, she's relived.  Knowing her, she'll hate herself for it, but its the right thing to do.
