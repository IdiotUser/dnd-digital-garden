Amy noticed the smell first.  That lingering stench of tobacco that was the telltale sign of a smoker.  Sure enough, her eyes caught sight a red mote, no less than 100m infront of her.  How had she not seen it earlier?  Amy's pace slowed, as she firmed the grip on the key placed between thumb and forefinger.

Amy had stayed at the office later than she planned.  It had been forecast to be a nice day, so she had elected to walk to the work.  By the time she left the foyer, the street lights were already glaring down at her.  Amy had tried the door, determined to wait for a cab, but the card-reader just beeped unhappily.  She reasoned a brisk walk wouldn't kill her, and set off towards her flat.

Then weather decided to make a fool of the Bureau of Meteorology so she picked up the pace, going faster than might be reasonable in her heels, although Amy doubted she would make it home without being completely saturated.

Now, standing in the rain, a stranger between her and the end of a narrow alley which, by day had been quaint, but by night felt downright sinister – *like the setting of one of my slasher films* Amy though ruefully – she wished she had taken the car.

"Ey las... you just gonna stand in the rain... or you want... want the shelter...?" a man's voice – *of course it was a man* – called out to her.  the voice sounded feeble, a wheezing breath forcing itself between every couple words, punctuated by a hacking cough at the end. *Well at least I know I can probably out run him* Amy considered *and his lungs will probably give up he tries to exert himself, so I can probably take him.  Probably.* – congratulating herself for not being "fun" in uni, Amy made her decision.

As she approached the man (*it was a man, right?  you're fault for being a creep if I'm wrong.  Well that's hardly fair now, is it? What do you care?  Shouldn't you be on my side? I am on your side.  Oh really?.  yes, and you're staring.  I should probably ask his name*) "hey, whats–" she was interrupted by a strong breeze blew through the alley, carrying with it a wall of vile smoke that reminded her of her "fun" roommate in first year, who turned their room into a hot-house and made her professor think she was high; presently struck her mid stride, causing her to stumble the last few meters to the shelter; and promised to permeate her very being should she linger longer than a few minutes.

"Apologies" wheezed the man, sincerely, who stepped back to the far end of the awning (it was little more than a kind gesture, mercifully, the breeze chose that moment to die), but made no effort to put out the cigarette (which hampered his sincerity in Amy's estimations). "You ha-*HACK*... had a question?" *hmm, does he sound Brittish?*

"Ermm, yes... what's your name?" Amy replied softly, not wanting to take too many deep breaths in the man's presence.

"Ha" He laughed, *or coughed?*, "Vile" wheezed Vile, as he took a drag of his diminishing cigarette.

"Vile?"

*Wheeze* "Yes?" *Hack, wheeze*.

"You're name is Vile?"

*HACK* "Ey..." *a drag* "My-"

"Why–oh, no sorry, go on.", Amy interrupted, abashedly.

"*HACK*...No-*HACK, HACK*... problem *HACK*.  My-"  The man's coughs progressed to a fit, as he hunched over wheezing.  He took a final, long drag of the stub, which seemed to jumped from his hand in a bid for freedom, and flitted to the ground, ready to begin its new life before it was stamped out.  As a spark flashed across his face, she caught a glimpse of his face – wrinkled and stained – before the cigarette is replaced.  *god, how much does he smoke?  Has he ever stopped?* "Father's... idea of... joke".

It seemed to Amy like Vile was limiting his words, presumably so he could fit a sentence between fits.  It also seemed like Vile's father had a terrible sense of humour *although this is a strong case for nominative determinism*.

In the early morning sun, Amy got her first proper look at the man that wasn't lit by his lighter, or a cigarette. Vile was younger than she though, but no less aged.  *Doesn't look that much older than me.*  *If I smoked, would I look like that?* Amy thought with morbid curiosity.
