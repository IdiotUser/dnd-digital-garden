E: A new, but very loyal fan?

L: and how'd you get past R?

E: bribery?

L: Figures.

E: 2 figures, but not a measly 2.

L: *exacerbated* No I mean *sign, pinches bridge of nose* No, you were saying I was wasted here?

E: Oh defiantly, but that's not why I'm here?

L: If not to insult my livelihood, why are you here?

L: *Arrg* Not you people again!  Piss off and leave me alone.

E: Oh thank the gods!

L: yeah, praise M and so on.

E: I mean I told them this wouldn't work.

L: Uh huh, sure.

E: No seriously I told them–

L: What part of piss off don't you understand.

L: What!

E: Wasn't a very good fight is all.

L: Oh yeah, and how you reckon that?

E: Well technically it was a good fight, you we quick, kept you guard, you

L: get to the point.

E: *breathlessly* You out match everyone in this building, happy?

L: *smirk scoff, humourless*
L: Tell me something I don't know.

E: I know where you can find a good fight.

L: Oh please, not this again, I told you I'm not interested inn you're good of the country nonsense.

E: Oh gods no, not that recruiting spiel, I mean a proper challenge.

L: *same reaction, but this time with some mirth, eyes E* 
L: What, you?

E: Hey!  Why I have no doubt I could take any one of those losers out there, I said a proper challenge.  Something you're not guaranteed to win.

L: I'm listening.  You have until I'm done here.

E: Well, the company YES I KNOW BUT HEAR ME OUT! 
E: *Pauses, expecting pushback*

L: *smirks while packing*

E: *clears throat*

E: Right well, for me it's not just the opportunity, and high & mighty messaging.  That stuff helps, but it's not why I keep doing it, right?

E: *waits for L to stop and nod before continuing*
E: Before this job, I've never had many excuses to get into proper fights with people who know what they're doing, not that that stopped me, but now it's regular work, I don't have to do the clear up after!  

*E gets franticly faster as L finishes packing, heading for the door*

Its–its... fun!

L: *stops*
L: You think I do this 'cause it's fun?

*beat*

E: er... yes?

L: *ha, she spits* I guess you right.  S'pose pays' not bad neither?

E: Oh, you'll earn in a day what you earn here in a week!  I'll tell you a secret, whatever your price is, double it.

L: That what you did?

E: Oh yeah, at first.  But now I'm earning 20gp a month!

L: *hmm*

E: So, what do you say?

L: Haven't decided.

E: What!?  But that was a good pitch, I mean I–

L: Give me a minute!

E: Alright alright!

*L thinks, comes to a conclusion, and counts 20 10ths just to punish E*

L: Sound good.

E: Oh that's–Wait, really!

L: Yeah, why not.  Been meaning to ditch this place anyway, see you around.

*L leaves*

E: Damn... praise the gods I'm good.

# 2

E: So, how much you get?

L: 10gp.

E: Damn, that sucks, guess we can't all earn as much as me.  Should have gone higher, did you do what I suggested?

L: Yeah.  10gp a week.

E: Wait what!  H-how, that more than I earn.

L: mmmh.  Well took you're price, and I doubled it, more actually.

E: I'm speaking to G about this!

L: Who?

...

L: Yeah well thanks for the advice.  Once you've finished that, I'll shout  a round.

E: Oh you're shouting more than a round.  You're shouting every round until I earn as much as you.

L: Hmmm, might take a while then.

E: Hey!  I–gods preserve me...
