Before the [[Blackening]], wealthy merchants operated a system of horse waystations whereby post would be handed from rider to rider until it arrived at its destination.  The use of such came with a hefty price and was thus reserved for the gentry who could afford such luxuries.

For the common folk there existed a different system, couriers.  Couriers were individuals such as members of a merchant caravan or theatre troupe who may be travelling in a particular direction and will carry your letter.

What of the Elves and fae-folk of the Woodwodes?  At the outbreak of the Blackening, the fae isolates their lands, barring foreigners from the wodes.  Plague dunes were put in place for the continuation of small trade, and as clear markers of the borders of the wode.  Those who tried to enter found themselves walking in circles, awaking near their entrance with pockets of coin, or turned back by wodewardens (note that the coin generally came from wodewardens,
