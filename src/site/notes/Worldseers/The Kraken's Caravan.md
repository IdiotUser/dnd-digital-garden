We begin in a town at the very end[^1] of what was once the Kraken's Caravan â€“ The lens through with we will analyse the geopolitics of NOW (read: we'll get into it later).  It does not have a name, the locals simply refer to it as "[[The Town|the village]]", and nobody else cares to call it anything at all.  In time this will change, so, as the omniscient observers we are, we will call it Pen-y-Ffordd (the end of the road).


 Pen-y-Ffordd (ar Cracen)
The end of the road (on the kraken)

Mountains seperate Pen-y-Ffordd from greater \[UK analog] and [[Valonier]][^2]

[[NOW_ Scorched Sea.docx|Agnatha]] is an arid plane separated by impassable mountains on opposite sides, a great rift on another, and an unforgiving desert, beyond which lies An \[Ottoman analog] and the remains of a parted sea (presumable the other side fell into the aforementioned rift.)

Somewhere on the white sea (possibly Pomors in Arkhangelsk), with elements from Lake Baikal (i.e: spiny amphipod soup)

[[Autonomous mountain region of Pahad|Pahad]]









[^1]: Technically the Caravan never reached this far, but ignore that for the sake of me.
[^2]: Yes, I am just going to port Valonier off from Sunset Fortune (I made it after all), no you can't stop me (and I'm not telling Nikola).
