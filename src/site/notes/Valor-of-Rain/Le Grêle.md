A few hundred metres off the shore of [[Vieillesse-Sur-Mer]] lies Le Grêle (lit. The Hailstone).  Le Grêle is a severe little fortress surrounded by jagged rocks on all sides, accessible only at low tide by a causeway to the mainland.  Le Grêle, originally built as part of the sea defences of the city, serves as a maximum security prison, generally holding political prisoners.  It derives its name from the harsh conditions faced by its inmates due its exposure to the strong prevailing winds — winds which make Versailles an excellent port city.
