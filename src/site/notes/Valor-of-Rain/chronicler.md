> *The off-white-robed figure approaches, walking with an uneven, yet purposeful gait.  He reaches out to you, looking to all the world like another of [[Valor-of-Rain/Capitol\|Capitol]]'s crippled beggars.
> "HARKON TRAVELER!  I am the custodian of the [chronicles of Mwarf](Mwarf's%20Tome.md), first herald of the one true God, [BARrY](BARrY); I am keeper of the [[Shard of the key to his tomb\|Shard of the key to his tomb]];  and last Steward of The [[Valor-of-Rain/Order of the Apostle\|Order of the Apostle]]."* 

Seeming (Description:: a crippled beggar with delusions of grander), the chronicler bears only the artefacts of his order, and rags with which to show his humility.  He owns nothing and covets nothing; seeking only to retain knowledge so others may know.
# Equipment
[[Valor-of-Rain/Mwarf's Tome\|Mwarf's Tome]]

The Chronicler dons a cloak of white rabbit pelts, those of the heathen order Mwarf once belonged to.  ([[_Game Resources/_SRD/Spells/Speak with Dead\|Speak with dead]] allows communion with the creatures sacrificed to make the cloak)

The [[Shard of the Key to the Tomb\|Shard of the Key to the Tomb]] of [BARrY](BARrY) is but a fragment of an [[ancient amulet\|ancient amulet]] once carried by Mwarf.  It was said to be able to unlock the [Box](BARrY%20Box) that held BARrY captive.  The location of the other fragments are lift to time.
# Chronicles 
The Chronicles speak of an ancient order of knights, The [[Cult of Alstriza\|Cult of Alstriza]], whom with one of Mwarfâ€™s First Company belonged to.  The COA are fierce foes and great allies.  The  [[Chroniclers\|Chroniclers]] still holds vestiges of this ancient alliance.
