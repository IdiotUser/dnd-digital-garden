[[Jean-Luc|Jean]] lies on his bare cot, in the tiny stone-walled cell, facing the sea.  He listens as the wind howls, and the guards do their rounds.  Two pairs of footsteps every few minutes, like clockwork.  Until something new.  A single set of footsteps getting louder, and then stopping before his door, and knocking.

“Monsieur…?” the guard sounds uncertain.

“Oui?”

“Monsieur La Fere?” Jean does not recognise the voice.

“Oui,” Jean wonders if his time has come.

“Le Rouget?” the guard whispers excitedly.

“A question for the judge.”

Jean hears the sound of a key being fumbled into the lock.  

“Perhaps, but…”

Jean presses himself against the back if his tiny cell, prepared to fight his end.

The door clicks, “You are to come with me,” says the guard as he opens the door, before Jean presses the shiv to his neck.  The guard’s eyes go wide.

“You speak, you die,” Jean pats him down, taking the knife from his belt “Nod if you understand.”

He nods, slowly.

“Where’s your weapon?” the guard makes to move, Jean applied the blade further “stop!” he hisses as the guard complies “do you want me to slit your throat?”

The guard looks down at his neck.

“You can tell me where the weapon is,” Jean says as he loosens the pressure

The guard swallows, “merci monsieur… euh, you have it?”

“You only brought a knife” Jean asks, “and you went into a prisoner’s cell?”

“Oui.”

“Are you crazy?  And where’s your partner?”

“Upstairs.” he replies.

“Well how’s he going to help you there?”

“ah, well... I did not expect you to have a knife.”

“Standard procedure,” Jean shrugs, ~~thinks for a moment, then shrugs and lowers the blade, “I do not think you are a real guard.”~~

~~“Euh, not really,” guard smiles sheepishly.~~

Then Jean has a thought, and says to the guard "~~what colour does the crown bleed?~~ Through the dark, sly and keen"

"The fox walks, unseen," returns the guard, correctly.

~~"Red, the red of the setting sun," the not-guard replies hastily.~~

Jean lowers the blade, “Monsieur, I do not think you are a real guard.  So, why have you come?"

“I have come for you, Monsieur Rouget,” says the guard and, perhaps sensing Jean’s impatience, adding hastily, “we are breaking you out.”

“We”

“Oui.”

As if on queue, a set of footsteps comes rushing down the stairs.

“Marcel?” comes a whisper, “Marcel, we have to hurry.  Have you found him?“[^1]

The not-guard Marcel looks to Jean, who shrugs, then leans through the open doorway “Francois, in here!  I have him.”

Jean peers around Marcel in time to watch a another not-guard skids into the first as the hug tightly.  He waits politely for a moment before clearing his throat, “ahem, monsieurs?”

“Ah!  Where are my manners” Marcel exclaims “Francois meet-“


“Oui, oui, lovely to meet you monsieur, but you mentioned we were in a hurry?”
  
“Right, yes” says Francois, flustered, “We bought ourselves some time, but the other guards are bound to be on their next round by now.”

And then they’re pushing through the front gate, Jean taking his first steps as a free man as fast as he can.  It's low tide, they’re bounding across the [[Le Grêle|causeway]], running towards the tall stone walls of [[Capitale|Vieillesse]], towards... the blast of canons?  Has he missed a festival?  He was sure it had only been a few days.  That's when he realises why their escape was so easy, as he continues to run towards a city in riot.

...

Francois was shot as they neared the end of the causeway.  They left him in their wake to be taken by the guards, or the sea.  Marcel called out to the tower as they reached its steps – the same one he had been marched out of not three days earlier – by now Jean was exhausted, the initial rush of freedom replaced by aching muscles.  His addled mind could only focus on his next steps.  Even then, he almost tripped on the slime covered rocks, needing Marcel to catch him as they scrambled up the slick stairs.

Jean was practically dragged the final steps and through the iron gate, faintly he the scrape of metal on stone reached him as he sucked as much of the salted air as possible. 

%%We're not through yet... get to safe-house%%

...

%%dialogue about Francois, woman comforts Marcel, next actions, Jean falling asleep to the sounds of mourning, and riot%%

Not feeling particularly well rested, Jean bemoaned his life as he was awoken by Marcel in the dead of night.  He shut up when he noticed Marcel looked as bad as he felt, and realised Marcel had probably taken an extended watch so Jean could sleep.  Jean thought longingly of breakfast and a razor as he was bundled into a heavy coat and pushed out the door.

Last night – or perhaps earlier this night – the safe-house had muffled the chaos of the street.  The quiet had been comforting inside.  Now it was eerily quiet, you could have been forgiven for thinking the city had been deserted.  Only distant fires, and the occasional boom of a canon suggested to where the tide of revolutionaries had turned their efforts.

They stalked through the mostly empty streets, empty of people, not of the discards of ransacked shops and homes.  Occasionally, as they would pass similarly displaced figures, both parties ducking similarly into alcoves, or backtracking through narrower streets.  The pace was slow, and once they had to navigate through a surprisingly well established pile of refuse, in which a [[chronicler|ratty figure]] was settled.  Eventually they stopped in an alley that opened onto a larger street.  Opposite the alley was a tavern, notable for being the only place that had looked ransacked before the looting had started.  There in the alley they waited.

The building slouched smugly on its neighbours, a quirk of shoddy architecture that had meant a discounted rent, and lower property values on the whole street.  Several times it had been slated for a facelift – once even for demolition – by prospecting young city planners.  Whenever such ideas became plans, the planner was shut down by a visit from a stranger, and a heavy purse.  Usually this was motivation enough for the overworked and under-appreciated staff at the city planning office.  For one man, it was not.  When he returned to work a few days later, looking the worse for wear, his coworkers declined to comment.

Marcel was beginning to nodded off when Aude pointed up to a lit candle in the window of an upper story that had not been lit before.  Jean shook Marcel awake and they proceeded to the front door of their slice of the revolution.  Jean tried the lock, thought for a moment, then knocked thrice and twice more.

"We changed the code," said Aude.

"Well I was not informed," replied Jean haughtily, "what was I to do if I came back?"

"Wait outside I suppose," shrug Aude as she knocked once, then thrice rapidly, and once again.

The door swung open as Jean made a comment to the room, informing them he could pick locks.  The room did not respond.

...

Jean was brought upstairs to a sitting room by scraggily young man – with what, in Jean's estimations, was a lesser moustache than his own – who left hastily, closing the door behind him.  The room was well furnished – if not worn and outdated, halfway to historic even – besides the door he had come through, there was a set of heavy wooden doors, and a small window.[^2]

...

Jean was awoken by tense whisperings as the heavy doors emitted several sets of footsteps.  Jean heard the footsteps to fade, and the smaller door closing before someone cleared their throat in a manner that suggested they had not needed to do so, was very busy don't you know, and had had quite enough of your antics already, thank you.

Jean opened one eye to [[Madeleine]], one of the leaders of their revolutionary cell, watching him critically.

"lieutenante."

"Le Rouget," said Madeleine.

"Have you noticed I am not in prison?"

"Quite a remarkable change," nodded Madeleine sagely.

"What do you want?"

"Can I not simply want the freedom of an innocent man?"

"Ha.  You and I both know I'm not innocent," said Jean, before continuing ruefully "You made sure of that."

"I confess, I am aware of your crimes."

"Ah, and so I am of yours.  Is that why I am free?  So I would not speak?"

"The [[Gabriel|King]] has ways of getting information without you speaking, Olivér," countered Madeleine, 
"and anyway, that is not the reason."

"Is it because of our strong familial bond?" suggest Jean, which earns him a tired look.

"You know the reason."

"No I don't!  How could I possibly know what you're planning?  For what possible reason could you want to see me while our city burns outside your window!  Hmm, Madeleine?"

Madeleine presents a pair of toggles.  Jean watches as she lets one fall, which is caught by a loop of wire connecting it to the other: *le loupe*, a garrotte.  When Jean does not responded, Madeleine begins, "Must I?"

"Oui," says Jean sternly.

"I have a job for you."

"I could refuse."

"You promised."

"I don't enjoy this."

"I know."

Jean takes the garrotte.

They had pulled up the street pavers to construct a [barricade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Les_Misérables_-_François_Flameng_-_La_guerre_entre_quatre_murs_%28la_barricade%29.jpg)

%%Jean realises that these are not the kings chambers.  did Madeleine give him the wrong directions?  No, she had sent him here to kill the princess, and to his horror, he found he was prepared to do so.%%
