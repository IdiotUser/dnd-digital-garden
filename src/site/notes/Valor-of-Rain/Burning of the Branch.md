Legend speaks of [[cult of Alstriza\|cult of Alstriza]] (COA) as a blasphemous sect of the church of [[Sunset-Fortune/Compendium/Lathandite Theology\|lathandrite]] who began to worship a [[BARrY\|false god]].  It is said that the [[Paladins of Valonier\|Paladins of Valonier]] - greatest knights of the realm, 12 Peers to King Antioch the Just and True - were sent forth to vanquish the blasphemers at their place of unholy worship. They set fire to the church, putting a stop to the heretics in one fell swoop.  From there, the Paladin’s wrath is likened to their king (just and true) and acting with extreme prejudice.

[[The chronicles\|The chronicles]] tells different tale.  One of…

They tell of [[Mwarf\|Mwarf]], aldersainfoin of the COA gathering the 12 Cants - 12 Cants set against the 12 Peers that are their mirror.  Henceforth I cannot interpret the chronicle’s meaning, bar a ritual of brimstone, or that of the blessing of [[BARrY\|BARrY]].  These are the final entries in the chronicles of Mwarf.

Two conflicting stories?  Perhaps, but I think not so. ~~Legend is often based on truth~~  The chronicles do not lie, but the truth is incomplete.  The legend is just that; legend.  However, at the centre of every legend there is a small truth.  From this I determine two things.  1, the Paladins were sent to deal with a threat to the status quo; 2, the ritual was complete.  Why do I reckon this?  Does fire seem the paladins’ modem operandi?  Why would a Paladin, a bastion of righteousness, take the “cowards” way out of engagement rather than face it?
