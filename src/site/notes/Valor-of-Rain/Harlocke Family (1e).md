# %%Introduction%%
(description::)

%%This text should directly follow the title of the page, there should be no heading as seen on this section.

**

Primary notes:
- Family reside in the (name) district of (Valonier Proper), (Valonia)
- Made their fortune in the wine and spirits trade business/trade (probably after building of the backs of their damned relatives)
- Own a vineyard outside the city walls. Medium security
- Notoriously proud High Elves, bearing the same irk with mankind as many of their otherkin.(can’t say I blame them on account of the horror of the 2nd age)[^2]

> [!NOTE]
> *The Harlockes have been steadily climbing the social rankings for a while now. Hard to believe they went from another uninteresting name from Coxcomb Abby not 2 years ago, to a now almost feared family and major magnate within the economical hailstorm that is Valonier. I’m not sure what those yellow knife ears do to their wine but it obviously works (and i won’t believe it’s legal).* ~ **Barkley, M. \[old date]**[^1]
# Organisation

There are 6 of them (that we know of). The supposed head of the family, Francis Harlocke, looks to have been pulling all the strings and elevating the family's status for their entire existence within Valonier. He is a ruthless and cunning businessman (and far from humble) whose lineage apparently goes back further back than we initially thought. His spouse, her mistress Pennelope Harlocke, is a woman rarely seen apart from her partner. All that is known is that she moved to Valonier with him from () where she had been wed and had one child. His legacy, 3 children, Chance, Paris and heir Marla. Marla, the eldest, has been touted as sourer than her father and just as conniving. Obviously having her fathers inherent expertise in commerce she was set to inherit the family once her father would have to leave the helm. Chance, the youngest of the family being in his late teens, is a student studying abroad at (). Our intelligence does not tell us when or if he’ll be returning.

Paris, the middle child is a man with adept martial skills having recently been knighted though there is no evidence that he could prove them in a real battle. He follows his family's every command yet appears to be the most independent out of all of them. It is a known fact he holds a large fondness for academics, regularly attending[^3] the city's \[libraries] and spending hours reading and conversing with other scholars[^4]. Paris has been a point of discussion between us many a time as intelligence suggests he is hiding [[Cult of Alstriza|something]][^5] from the public and potentially even his family.
