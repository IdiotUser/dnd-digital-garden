Seeming (Description:: a crippled beggar with delusions of grander), the chronicler bears only the artefacts of an ancient order, and rags with which to show humility.  The Chronicler owns nothing and covets nought but information, seeking to harbour knowledge so others may know it in future.

# Physical Description
Bullet wound, left shoulder, sustained [[Valor-of-Rain/Sessions/4.01.03\|4.01.03]].
# Relationships
## Paris *"[daltán](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/daltán#Old_Irish)"* Harlocke
The Chronicler's relationship with the young heir may be seen as peculiar in that it is.  The Chronicler had a habit of entering libraries and the like without express permission, seeking knowledge.  Such visits were usually swiftly ended by security responding to complaints of foul odours and unsightly figures.  During one such visit, while Paris was searching for information regarding \[Something] — information that the library could not provide — The Chronicler approached him, claiming expertise in the subject.  This conversation was interrupted by security whom apologised to Paris for the intrusion and (removed the Chronicler from the premises or Paris handed the Chronicler his library card so they could continue their conversation.)

This was the first of many such conversations, generally taking place as the Chronicler lead Paris through Valonier on his round though piles of rubbish looking for things to sell, eat, or secret in his nest.  Beggars were a fixture of the city, and the Chronicler was no different.  When Paris had the time, he would simply walk through the Eastern gate and down an alley, ask a question, and Blánc would be by side, ready with the answer — or what he took to be an answer, it wasn't always clear what Blánc meant, or if he had understood the question; but he was always adamant he was correct.  Occasionally he would stop suddenly, remove a musty old tome from his cloak — done with such a reverence you would think it the written words of a god — before opening to seeming a random page and procuring the answer.  Paris had never seen the inside of the book, the few times he has tried, Blánc had hidden it beneath his cloak with such swiftness one would not think possible of the old scholar.  One the rare occasion that Blanc did not have the answer on hand, Paris would fine they had stopped at a portal, door ajar.  Initially he had been hesitant to step through the thresholds, but Blanc has always been quite insistent.  The first time he allowed himself to pass through, Paris found he had entered the stacks of \[library], seemingly through a back passage…

Occasionally Blanc would lead Paris through an open street and the pair would be spotted:

Gave me a right shock when I realised it was some old beggar-man he was followin'.  They was animated 'bout it too — spoke with such an \[eloquence] youd've t'ought they were holding court right there in the streets!"* ~ Cearl & Co.

## [[Valor-of-Rain/Aos\|Aos Eiscir]]
The Chronicler belongs to the Aos Eiscir, whom formed much of The Chronicler's values.

## Vermin of Valonier
Thanks to Blanc's gnomish heritage, he shares communion with the vermin of the great city.  They gossip, sharing the goings on of the city, and in this way Blánc might not waste time with the broadsheets of yesterday.  Instead, Blánc may simply listen as the city makes its announcements.

Note: Rats that reside on the surface are bigger, stronger, being closer to the food, fighting for the best food.  Those that must live in the under-city fight for any food at all.  They must avoid the hazards of flood,

# Equipment
[[Valor-of-Rain/Mwarf's Tome\|Mwarf's Tome]]

The Chronicler dons a cloak of white rabbit pelts, those of the heathen order Mwarf once belonged to.  ([[_Game Resources/_SRD/Spells/Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]] allows communion with the creatures sacrificed to make the cloak)

The [[Shard of the Key to the Tomb\|Shard of the Key to the Tomb]] of [BARrY](BARrY.md) is but a fragment of an [[ancient amulet\|ancient amulet]] once carried by Mwarf.  It was said to be able to unlock the [Box](BARrY%20Box) that held [[Valor-of-Rain/BARrY\|BARrY]] captive.  The location of the other fragments are lost to time.
# Chronicles 
The Chronicles speak of an ancient order of knights, The [[Valor-of-Rain/Cult of Alstriza\|Cult of Alstriza]], whom with one of Mwarf’s First Company belonged to.  The COA are fierce foes and great allies.  The  [[Chroniclers\|Chroniclers]] still holds vestiges of this ancient alliance.
