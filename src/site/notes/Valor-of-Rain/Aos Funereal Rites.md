# Last Rites
## Preservation of skin 

In generations past, tattoos were not an uncommon occurrence among the [[Valor-of-Rain/Aos\|Aos]], being viewed, if only from a historian, as a pragmatic media on which to write one’s history.  For a culture set on the preservation of such history, it seemed prudent to preserve a person’s painted pelt.  

Occasionally, forward thinking Aosi arrange their ink into regular shapes, going so far as to include dotted lines over which to cut, so that their skin might be bound between covers for easy of use. 

Such skins (both bound and unbound) continue to be preserved by dedicated epidermal archivists who regularly applying a moisturising lotion to them.  Indecently, they themselves are commonly noted as having similarly soft skin, albeit less inked.

And so it has come to be that a highly anointed butcher may be present at one of an Aosi’s (pronounced eiss/ess eyes) last rites while preparing the body.

In modern times the practice is less common , especially among the younger generations (and generally in such a manor as to not warrant skinning - most possessing few tattoos if any, and often the artist or subject keeps the original paper sketches for prosperity).

  

# Final deposition

Once the body is prepared, it brought to the [[Valor-of-Rain/Orchadia\|Orchadia]], where a tree becomes the memorial.  

The final ceremony is a highly guarded secret, notable for not having any written mention among Aos texts accessible by our researchers.  It is unclear if the body is buried at the foot of the tree; is entombed within a hollow; or grows into the tree.  What is known is that the Aos are said to be able to commune with the dead within the orchard.  Such a process has not yet been observed.
