[[Mwarf\|Mwarf]]'s Tome (the chronicles of Mwarf, or simply, the Chronicles) is (Description:: a large tome, bound in the petrified bark of a long extinct tree).  It’s pages appear blank to those not verse in the [Druid's tongue](Druid.md#Druidic); only the patterns in the grain of the paper being visible.  ~~Having proficiency in druidic allows one to interpret the patterns, unlocking a history to elder days.~~

It is said that the pages came from the trees to whom Mwarf told his tales — being so moved as they were, to shed their bark — so that they may be known, and the trees travel with them.

~~It was an undeniable fact that Mwarf carried a unique spellbook.  It was unfortunate, however, that Mwarf became such an iconic figure of history.  The result being that any [[Valor-of-Rain/Aos\|Aos]] test would bare semblance to it – coupled with Mwarf's distinct gnomish stature, any first age historian would have found an uncanny resemblance between the Aos and Mwarf.~~

Mwarf's Tome is a particular variation on the [[Valor-of-Rain/Orchadia#Manuscripts\|Aos Manuscripts]], being the coalesced memories of a single, still living person.  The practice was generally reserved for the Aldsainfoin, as well as Aos scouts.
