[[Mwarf\|Mwarf]]'s Tome (the chronicles of Mwarf, or simply, the Chronicles) is (Description:: a large tome, bound in the petrified bark of a long extinct tree).  It’s pages appear blank to those not verse in the [Druid's tongue](Druid.md#Druidic), only the patterns in the grain of the paper being visible.  Having proficiency in druidic allows one to interpret the patterns, unlocking a history to elder days.

It is said that the pages came from the trees to whom Mwarf told his tales — being so moved as they were, to shed their bark — so that they may be known and the trees travel with them.
