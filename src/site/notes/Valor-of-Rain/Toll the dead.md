The pendulum struck within his mind.  He could feel it hammering against the inside of his skull, followed by the throbbing pain that was the running of the bell.

The great vastness of the bell overwhelmed his sense.  At first he had tried to drown it out, but the bell just became greater.
Then, he tried to close his mind, to allow it Presence within his mind.  He deafened his ears; blinded his eyes; burnt his skin; and cut out his tongue. In return, his taste was the iron of the bell; touch, that of the hammer within; sight, the ripples of waves; sound, the rhythmic tolling of the bell.
It was then that he understood what the Presence demanded.  To be revered, to be witnessed.

The man climbed to the tallest tower in the city and, upon the breaking of the dawn, he allowed his mind to expand beyond his own awareness, to that of the waking people.  And it was heard.  Henceforth, the bell would toll at the breaking of the dawn and of the dusk.  Gradually, the bell would demand more, tolling during the mid-day and mid-night. 

This is how Valonier came to have it's bells.  At present, the bell tolls every half-hour and is heard by all in the city of Valonier, emanating from within the mind.  It is joined in chorus by three other bells of similar nature.  Those that hold the bells are deafened and blinded, so that they may focus on their true purpose.  These are the bell-keepers of [[Valor-of-Rain/Valonier\|Valonier]].
