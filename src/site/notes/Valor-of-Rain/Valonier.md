 > The Valorian mint was heavily regulated, the value of its coin being directly linked to equivalent Alastrian coin.  All Valorians must accept Alastrian coin as legal tender, and Valorian coin is not accepted outside of Valonier. [Barkley, M | History of the Red Rebellion](20240816T0940 The Red Rebellion)
