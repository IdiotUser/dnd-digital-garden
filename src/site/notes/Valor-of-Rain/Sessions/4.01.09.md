%%
I think it's really cool that each character has a different kind of power:  
- Paris has a name (and associated wealth),
- Esmée has money (seemingly tied up in the ship and associated assists),
- Blánc has knowledge (and not much else), and
- Anna has a certain air of mystery (given I don't know the character too well)

[^1]: Generally tense atmosphere, but rebels are harmless really.
