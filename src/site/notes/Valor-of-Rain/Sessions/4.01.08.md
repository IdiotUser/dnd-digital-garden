(Year:: 170AGW)-(Month::?)-(Day:: +1)

The Party attempts to flee from the fight,
Lord of Rain causes a tsunami by beating his wings, ejecting Blanc and Paris from the boat
Blanc [[_Game Resources/_SRD/Spells/Vortex Warp\|Vortex Warp]]s Raoul to the dock so he may fight the good fight,
Esmé drags the boat via a rope and her winds towards a ship,
Esmé introduces the party to her sailing ship worth tens of thousands of gold, no crew in sight.
