A groove of great importance to the [[Aos]], the Orchard is comprised of tree that contains the complete thoughts and memories of a single mind.

# The trees
The trees possess unique memetic properties in that gazing at inner layers of bark produces hallucinations in the observer.

It is posited that such an evolution might benefit the plant by overwhelming the senses of insects and animals that may otherwise intrude into exposed wood.

Evidently sapient species are able to weather the memetic effects, possibly due to a larger capacity for thought.  It has been proven that one can build a tolerance for the hallucinations with repeated exposure, allowing for greater control over it’s influence, being able to “skim” over information before “delving deeper” or ignoring the effects outright with enough practice.

# Cultivation
*See [[Aos Funereal Rites]] for further details*

The process of replanting the contents of a mind into a tree is, despite its inherent absurdity, rather simple.  So simple, that there is no need to explain it.

## Manuscripts
Often specific sections of bark are organised and arranged into singular [[Mwarf's Tome|tomes]], not unlike a book is comprised of pages.  Where as a book’s pages are printed for purpose, the manuscripts are constructed of pre-existing sheets.  It takes a deft hand and much research to produce a treatise on a particular subject, but the result is a marvellous thing.  Imagine a work so well written so as to be understandable by all persons, despite prior exposure to the content.  A work that transcends the limitations of the written form, accessible to all no their matter literacy or even tongue.  This is the result of a manuscript; the perfect work.  Unfortunately such things require an extremely tedious and involved process that might take the efforts of a whole lifetime or more, depending on desired subject and comprehension (not to mention the limited availability of Orchard resources).  They are the most sacred artefacts of the Aos.

There are, as a matter of course, manuscripts with more a focus in breadth then depth.  These are generally produced as a practical introduction to the Orchard for all young Aosi, based on well structured, fundamental subjects, and a few of personal interest, with the careful supervision of an instructor.  Such texts are deeply personal to the Aos, and are regularly added to and consulted throughout their life.
