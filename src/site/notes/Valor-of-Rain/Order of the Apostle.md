# %%Introduction%%
(description::)

%%This text should directly follow the title of the page, there should be no heading as seen on this section.

This section should include a basic description that takes less than a couple seconds to read. It should be descriptive, but not too descriptive.%%

# Mission

%%Be descriptive and explain what the faction's end goal is.
%%
# Ideology
%%Describe, in detail, what the faction's ideology and politics are.%%

# History
%%Describe in detail what the history of the faction is up until the current point. Try to make it interesting and informative while not being too long of a read.%%
The Chroniclers had once functioned as impartial observers of the natural course of history.  Keepers of knowledge and items of significance.  It wasn't until the burning of the stacks — whereby a large portion of the Chronicler's physical bibliotheca was consumed by a fire of unknown origin — and the fear that rogue elements would attempt to destroy the artefacts that the Chroniclers decided to disseminate the remains of the chronicles amongst themselves — becoming wandering stewards and itinerate annalists.

In time, many of the Chroniclers began to settle in Candle keep where the Great Library was rediscovered.  However, there are those of the old order who remain unassimilated for various reasons.


%%You can include a timeline of their history or important events if you want to.%%

# Organisation

%%Describe their training and level of expertise, rank structure, along with what the internal policies (rules, etc) of the faction are.

Also include a brief easy to read the description of the subunits of the faction. The name of each subunit should have a hyperlink leading to its own dedicated page.

Follow this example:%%

## Name of Sub faction %%(set a hyperlink to its page)%%

%%Brief description of who they are and what they do.  (Ideally, using a text block : ![#^])%%
