# History

The Chroniclers had once functioned as impartial observers of the natural course of history.  Keepers of knowledge and items of significance.  It wasn't until the burning of the stacks — whereby a large portion of the Chronicler's physical bibliotheca was consumed by a fire of unknown origin — and the fear that rogue elements would attempt to destroy the artefacts that the Chroniclers decided to disseminate the remains of the chronicles amongst themselves — becoming wandering stewards and itinerate annalists.

In time, many of the Chroniclers began to settle in Candle keep where the Great Library was rediscovered.  However, there are those of the old order who remain unassimilated for various reasons.
