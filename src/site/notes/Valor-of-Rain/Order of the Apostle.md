# Mission


# Ideology


# History
The Chroniclers had once functioned as impartial observers of the natural course of history.  Keepers of knowledge and items of significance.  It wasn't until the burning of the stacks - whereby a large portion of the Chronicler's physical bibliotheca was consumed by a fire of unknown origin - and the fear that rogue elements would attempt to destroy the artefacts that the Chroniclers decided to disseminate the remains of the chronicles amongst themselves - becoming wandering stewards.
