The Aos *(pronunciation: \[iːsˠ] is/s)* (Lit: *"people"*)
are an isolated ethnic and religious  group of gnomes, endemic to the [[moors\|moors]] of southern Valonier.

They speak primarily Asc, however multilingualism is common among prospective Aosa.
The nature of Asc as a "translator's" language allows it to be written in any script, however Ascii is most common, being developed alongside the Asc language.

Much like the Aos people, Asc 
# Mission

*see [[Valor-of-Rain/Humans, as seen by Aos\|Humans, as seen by Aos]] for motivations*

The goal of any Aos is the preservation of knowledge and culture.
# Ideology

Fundamental secular humanism

Aos 


Poetry is much celebrated in Aos communities as a form of oral history.
The recital of long prose as a profession of love is a phenomenon often seen taking place between two Aosa 


Many older Aos see informal language as almost sacrilegious.
In extreme cases, they may elect to only speak in an "unadulterated" variety of Asc characterised by iambic pentameter.  This form of Asc
# History





# Organisation
Broadly Aos can be seperated into northern and southern, however there exists no formal distinction between them.  For the untrained ear, it can practically impossible to discern an Aosa's heritage. 

Northern and Southern Aos pronounce Aos as \[iːsˠ] and \[eːsˠ] respectively.

> "*There exists a* virus of the mind *within our peoples.  We thought that our method of transference and preservation of information was our greatest blessing.  It was the foundation on which we rebuilt our culture, how we knew and understood it.  It was a curse.  Perhaps there was something in the things that became þe Orchard – like a hidden fungal infection spreading in the dark –  and we were simply the catalyst; or were we the mode of transmission, a bad idea that has tainted what was once pure?; It may not even be an external force.  It matters not the how nor the why, now it simply is; I have identified the corruption.  At first I though to extricate it, to cut the rot.  (if you have noticed an unusual amount of collective long-term memory loss, this is why)  I now know this is not possible, the virus is bound to our ideas, without which neither can survive.  Then I thought to cull; to amputate the infection.  This too was futile.  Only in isolation could I remove a meme, only for it to return on contact to the greater memeplex.  To think one might destroy an idea that permeated all of our memeplex?  Such an act is unfeasible.  Of course, this was before I made my greatest and most terrible discovery, the extent of its reach is unlimited; there is not a meme that is free of the virus.  There exists a* virus of the mind *within our peoples, it has no cure.  There is no way to stop its spread.  We should never have found those trees.  We should never have allowed ourself to link with them.  We should [[Valor-of-Rain/Burning of the Branch\|Burn them all]].  It is the only recourse.  Our people are doomed, but perhaps we can prevent it from happening to others.
