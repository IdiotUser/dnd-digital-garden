# Backstory:

A man grew up in a forest where the snow never stopped falling, and the cold cut through to the bone. It was a harsh, unforgiving place, where survival was a matter of instinct. There was no family, no real name, just the endless white wilderness and the unyielding silence. The forest was both a prison and a refuge, its vastness a reminder that nothing lasted here—not even memories.

From an early age, the man had learned to hunt, to track, and to disappear into the snowdrifts like a shadow. His world had always been the crunch of frozen ground beneath his boots, the call of distant wolves, and the sting of the wind. He was alone, but he had become used to it. He had no memories of a family, no recollection of who he was before. It was as though the forest had consumed him, leaving only the hunter behind.

Then, one day, another appeared—a man, an outsider, with eyes that gleamed with secrets. They met in the forest, at the edge of a clearing, where the man had tracked a wounded deer. The stranger spoke in riddles, his voice smooth and hypnotic, and the two quickly became companions, hunting together, living side by side. They formed an uneasy bond—one of necessity and shared isolation.

The man’s companion, as he came to think of him, was unlike anyone the man had ever known. He spoke of magic, of forces beyond understanding, of power beyond the mortal realm. He was a warlock, bound to an entity so great that it was more a force than a being—a being that could bend the laws of nature itself. The companion was desperate to break free of the pact he had made, but the dark power was not so easily escaped.

  

In an act of rebellion, the companion tried to sever his ties to the dark being, to free himself from the contract that had bound him. But the dark force was wrathful, and the consequences were swift. The companion was taken, dragged into the depths by the raven-beaked figure that had bound him in the first place. The man fought back, desperate to protect the only person who had ever shared his life in the cold, but the dark force was too strong. He was knocked unconscious, left broken and bleeding in the snow.

  

When the man awoke, the world had shifted. The cold still gnawed at him, but now, something else had taken root. His body felt strange, different—stronger, yet more hungry. The curse of lycanthropy had taken hold of him, a gift and a curse bestowed by the very force he had tried to fight. His mind spun, fractured by the pain and the overwhelming change, but through it all, there was only one thought: vengeance.

  

The man tracked the being—the raven-beaked figure—through the snow, driven by the whispers that gnawed at the edges of his sanity. He knew the forest better than anyone, and yet, something about this figure felt wrong. The trees twisted in strange, unnatural shapes, their branches reaching toward him like dark fingers. The shadows stretched unnaturally long, and the moonlight seemed to flicker in and out, as if the sky itself was rejecting his pursuit.

  

It was then that he saw it—it.

  

The tall, thin figure stood before him, a silhouette in the moonlight. The raven’s beak gleamed in the darkness, and the very air around it crackled with a sense of foreboding power. The man’s heart pounded in his chest, and the rage built like a storm within him.

  

The man’s fingers tightened around the pistol left to him by his companion. It felt like a weight, a reminder of the price of this pursuit. His heart was a drumbeat, quickening with each passing second.

  

Without warning, the man lunged, teeth bared, clawing at the earth as his body twisted and shifted, forced by the curse to change. His human form gave way to the monstrous lycanthrope—his vision blurred, his senses heightened. Every fiber of his being screamed for the blood of the one who had stolen everything.

  

The figure raised its hand, the air rippling with dark energy. The ground cracked beneath its feet, and an unearthly wind howled through the forest, whipping through the man’s hair and fur. The raven-beaked figure’s presence twisted the very air, distorting reality itself.

  

With a flick of its wrist, the figure sent a wave of shadow towards the man, a blast of pure darkness that tore through the air. The man’s claws slashed through the shadows, but it was as though they had no substance—nothing to tear apart. He roared in frustration, his body growing heavier, slower under the pressure of the magic that bent the world around him.

  

The figure took a step forward, its form moving with unnatural grace, gliding through the air like a wisp of smoke. The man lunged again, his claws slashing, but the figure dodged effortlessly, too fast, too elusive. The man could feel the weight of his frustration, his fury mounting with each failed attempt to land a blow.

  

But the man’s fury would not be so easily extinguished. His mind screamed for the end of this pursuit, for the vengeance that had consumed him since that fateful day. He could feel the power of the curse surging through his veins, feeding his every movement.

  

And then, in a moment of blind rage, the man made his final strike, his fangs bared, aiming for the figure’s side. He lunged with all the power the beast inside him could muster, but his strike fell short. The figure moved again, just out of reach. The man’s fangs missed their target, sinking into the cold, empty air.

  

Frustration and pain overwhelmed him as he stood, teeth still bared, muscles taut with the effort. The figure hovered just out of reach, its dark magic pressing against him, unrelenting.

  

The world seemed to pause for a moment. The man stood there, breathing heavily, his mind clouded with rage and confusion. The beast within him howled for blood, but the figure remained untouched, effortlessly outmaneuvering every attack.

  

The figure stepped back, its presence chilling the air around them. The man, trembling with exhaustion, could feel his strength beginning to wane. His claws twitched, but the figure’s power was too overwhelming. The dark figure continued to watch, its eyes gleaming with an unsettling calm.

  

The man’s thoughts fractured, and his vision blurred as the magic took hold. The beast inside him howled in fury, craving the destruction of the figure before him. His claws itched to tear through the darkness that bound him, but the grip of the magic was too strong.

  

Then, the world snapped back into place.

  

The man fell to the ground, gasping for breath, the curse still writhing inside him. He couldn’t see clearly; the vision of the raven-beaked figure flickered in and out of focus. His mind was clouded with fragments of the battle, the pain, and the overwhelming sense of helplessness.

  

The fight had ended in a standstill. The man had failed to break the power that held his companion, and the raven-beaked figure had proven far stronger than he had imagined.

  

But the hunger for vengeance still burned in his heart, and in his fractured mind, the beast inside him howled once more.

  

The man would keep hunting.

  
  

# Appearance:
Winter's Bane is a tall, gaunt figure, his body draped in worn, rugged hunter’s boots and tattered clothing. His medium-length hair is unkempt, tangled in places, while a thick, overgrown beard hides much of his face, though his eyes betray his torment. Hundreds of scars mar his pale skin, evidence of countless sacrifices made in the pursuit of his cursed abilities. His sharp features seem weathered by pain, with deep lines etched into his face, and there’s a haunting intensity in his gaze, as if he’s forever looking for something or someone. His presence is unsettling, as though the very weight of his anguish is carried in every step he takes. A sharp, acrid scent lingers around him—like the stench of cold iron, blood, and damp earth, mixed with the faint, musty odor of fur from his lycanthropic curse. It's a smell that speaks of survival, suffering, and the harshness of the wilderness he calls home.
