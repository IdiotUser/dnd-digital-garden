What remains of the 12 Grand Demesnes is now but one, the Demesne of Rains (French: *domaine de la pluie*), colloquially Flotteterra.

Each Grand Demesne was under the protection of one of the 12 peers of Valonier (_Pairie de l'Valér_), characterised by their blue bonnets.

	6 ecclesiastical peers
		Archbishop-duke (_Archidiocèse_), premier peer
		2 Bishop-dukes(_Diocèse_)
		3 Bishop-Counts (_Diocèse_)
	6 Lay peers
		3 dukes (_Duc_), 1 premier lay peer
		3 Counts (_comte_)

Each Grande Demesne was designated as either a pairie-duché or pairie-comté for duchies and counties respectively.
