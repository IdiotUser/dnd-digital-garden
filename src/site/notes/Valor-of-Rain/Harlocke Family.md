Primary notes:
- Family reside in the (name) district of (Valonier Proper), (Valonia)
- Made their fortune in the wine and spirits trade business/trade (probably after building of the backs of their damned relatives)
- Own a vineyard outside the city walls. Medium security
- Notoriously proud High Elves, bearing the same irk with mankind as many of their otherkin.(can’t say I blame them on account of the horror of the 2nd age)[^2]

> [!NOTE]
> *The Harlockes have been steadily climbing the social rankings for a while now. Hard to believe they went from another uninteresting name from Coxcomb Abby not 2 years ago, to a now almost feared family and major magnate within the economical hailstorm that is Valonier. I’m not sure what those yellow knife ears do to their wine but it obviously works (and i won’t believe it’s legal).* ~ Personal account from Paris Harlocke (date)[^1]
# Organisation

There are 6 of them (that we know of). The supposed head of the family, Francis Harlocke, looks to have been pulling all the strings and elevating the family's status for their entire existence within Valonier. He is a ruthless and cunning businessman (and far from humble) whose lineage apparently goes back further back than we initially thought. His spouse, her mistress Pennelope Harlocke, is a woman rarely seen apart from her partner. All that is known is that she moved to Valonier with him from () where she had been wed and had one child. His legacy, 3 children, Chance, Paris and heir Marla. Marla, the eldest, has been touted as sourer than her father and just as conniving. Obviously having her fathers inherent expertise in commerce she was set to inherit the family once her father would have to leave the helm. Chance, the youngest of the family being in his late teens, is a student studying abroad at (). Our intelligence does not tell us when or if he’ll be returning.

Paris, the middle child is a man with adept martial skills having recently been knighted though there is no evidence that he could prove them in a real battle. He follows his family's every command yet appears to be the most independent out of all of them. It is a known fact he holds a large fondness for academics, regularly attending[^3] the city’s library and spending hours reading and conversing with other scholars[^4]. Paris has been a point of discussion between us many a time as intelligence suggests he is hiding [[Valor-of-Rain/Cult of Alstriza\|something]][^5] from the public and potentially even his family.

[^3]: Being a member of all of the prestigious independent libraries of the great city.
[^4]: i.e: in coffeehouses.
[^5]: having often been seen in the company of a beggar, having long and animated conversations as he follows the man, scrounging for scraps, across the city.  

*"I was in a coach when the drive, probably a drunk, stopped suddenly, and despite my protestations, to allow a tall, handsome young gentleman to cross the street.  Those elves really are quite queer."*
*"'Was a most peculiar thing.  There I was, doin' me rounds when a gentleman emerges from the ally right before me eyes!  I t'ough 'my, that boy's got no reason to be walkin', let alone round in backalleys' and then the lady was givin' me a right ear-full 'bout being late to a party or some other — was gonna give 'er a piece of me mind when I realised he was talking to a scraggly lookin' dog by his side.  Gave me a right shock when I realised it was some old beggar-man he was followin'.  They was animated 'bout it too — spoke with such an \[eloquence] youd've t'ought they were holding court right there in the streets!"*
