Primary notes:
- Family reside in the (name) district of (Valonier Proper), (Valonia)
- Made their fortune in the wine and spirits trade business/trade (probably after building of the backs of their damned relatives)
- Own a vineyard outside the city walls. Medium security
- Notoriously proud High Elves, bearing the same irk with mankind as many of their otherkin.(can’t say I blame them on account of the horror of the 2nd age)[^2]

> [!NOTE]
> *The Harlockes have been steadily climbing the social rankings for a while now. Hard to believe they went from another uninteresting name from Coxcomb Abby not 2 years ago, to a now almost feared family and major magnate within the economical hailstorm that is Valonier. I’m not sure what those yellow knife ears do to their wine but it obviously works (and i won’t believe it’s legal).* ~ Personal account from Paris Harlocke (date)[^1]
