Throughout the Red Rebellion, all of the Valonian boarderlands were conquered, and much of the Heartlands.  After the assassination of Odo III, King of the Vals (latin: *rex Valorum*), what remained of the [[Amberlords\|Amberlords]] - House of Amber (*maison d'Ambre*) - surrendered.  As part of the signing of the peace treaty:
1. The [[Amberlords\|Amberlords]]' frontier military was dissolved, all assets being seized.
2. Captured lands of the Kingdom of Valonier, greatest of the 7 kingdoms, was split amongst the usurper's supporters.

As part of their conditions,
1. What remained of the Amberlords, House of Amber (*maison d'Ambre*), were allowed sovereignty over the last demesne that had yet to be captured.
