Step through the portal (leans to [[Valonier]])
Teardrop is cursed
Deitiy of [[Deejhai]]'s luck fragment intervenes, but
it costs time TIME JUMP
Raven queen's prophecy
[[Jean-Luc]] is running from the King's guard
[[Xang Carter]] is holding his loved one, who is then sliced in half by the reaper
Cold breeze, party wakes from slumber
on a grassy hill, Grey trees, withered black dirt, bare surroundings, gravel path
Deejhai's luck fragment sends out a beam of light, the party follows it down to the path
Jean-Luc picks up a rock
overcast skies
as the party crests a hill, they see a small settlement surrounded by a low stone wall
"Welcome to Gorgas"
Tipped over wagon, 3 commoner's bodies have been decomposing for a while.
Teared flesh.
Broken in doors, barricaded buildings
Bodies have been sliced, evidence of ghouls.  Disintegrated bodies and charring.
4 silver, 2 copper
Jean-Luc recognises these coins as belonging to alastria, comissioned 25 years ago.
The party enters a church, Jean-Luc prays, Xheng steals 150 gold, Deejhai identifies a glass pane of [[Lethandar]], the sun god.
Deejhai tells the party about the curse.
...
Xheng hears ghouls
re-enters church
...
Party charges at the ghouls
Xheng shoots crossbow, kills one ghoul
Deejhai fires his double barrelled flintlock.
Jean-Luc throws a knife at the beholder.
...
Battle ends ~~and down goes father Charles~~
Party introduce themselves to allies(?)
 - Air Genasi - Aero
 - Big Guy - Cedas
 - Rogue - [[Eda]]

*n* months have passed,
[[Valonier]] has been overrun by the [[Dread King's Horde]].
